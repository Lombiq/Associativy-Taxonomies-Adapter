# Associativy Taxonomies Adapter



## Project Description

Taxonomy adapter module for the Associativy (http://associativy.com) Orchard graph platform.

**Please do not open issues here! All Associativy issues should be on the [Associativy project site](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/associativy/).**

See the [Associativy homepage](http://associativy.com/).


## Documentation

The module lets you automatically generate Associativy graphs from content items organized through the Taxonomies module.

The graphs will be automatically built, taking all the Taxonomy terms into account. The only setup needed is that you need to add the relevant term content types to the graph. If the graph is an ad-hoc graph then you can do this from the admin site too.

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/associativy-taxonomies-adapter](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/associativy-taxonomies-adapter) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Associativy-Taxonomies-Adapter](https://github.com/Lombiq/Associativy-Taxonomies-Adapter) (Git repository)

Bug reports, feature requests and comments are warmly welcome, **please do so via GitHub**.
Feel free to send pull requests too, no matter which source repository you choose for this purpose.
